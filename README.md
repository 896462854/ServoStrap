ServoStrap
==========

servo-controlled reprap 3D printer


 i have made this code for the LMD18245 motor controller, 
  i have merged the pid code of  Josh Kopel 
    whith the code of makerbot servo-controller board,
  you can use this code on the some board changing some values.

   external ardware require a quadrature encoder, timing slit strip and a dc motor,
   all you can find inside an old printer, i have took it from canon and hp printers(psc1510)
   
   for motor controll you can choose different type of H-bridge, i have used LMD18245,
   you can order 3 of it on ti.com sample request, the hardware needed is explained on the datasheet but i'm drowing
   the schematic and PCB layout on eagle.
   
   here the youtube link of the test with this code: http://goo.gl/gAia5y
